## Overview

Led a team of five in the engineering design and testing of a low-cost pediatric prosthetic leg for our senior capstone project at UCLA. The device was engineered to mimic natural gait biomechanics while allowing easy adjustability as the child grows.

## Key Contributions

- Designed and modeled the full prosthetic assembly using SolidWorks and MATLAB.
- Developed a real-time computer vision pipeline to track gait behavior and detect when springs should be replaced to support growing children.
- Conducted iterative prototyping and mechanical testing to evaluate durability and performance.
- Managed procurement, timeline, and team coordination throughout the lifecycle.

## Outcome

- Built a functional prototype under budget (<$200).
- Presented at UCLA's Engineering Design Showcase.
- Recognized for integrating low-cost biomechanics with modern sensing for pediatric care.
