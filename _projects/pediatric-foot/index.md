## Overview

Led a team of five in the engineering design and testing of a low-cost pediatric prosthetic leg for our senior capstone project at UCLA. The device was engineered to mimic natural gait biomechanics while allowing easy adjustability as the child grows.

## Design and Development Process

Gait data from a 7-year-old and an adult was interpolated and scaled to approximate torque vs. angle curves for children aged 9 to 12 years. Growth charts were used to estimate body proportions based on initial weight at age 9. MATLAB was used to develop an interactive interface for adjusting parameters and generating desired torque curves for optimization. These were iteratively refined until natural gait cycles were achieved.

## Key Variables

- **\( L_0 \)**: Free length of the spring  
- **\( L_s \)**: Length of the spring  
- **\( \theta \)**: Angle that the pylon is tilted forward from equilibrium

To determine the torque contribution from each spring, the following calculations were performed.

The initial angle \( \alpha_0 \) between lengths \( l \) and \( r \) is found using the law of cosines:

$$
\alpha_0 = \cos^{-1}\!\left( \frac{r^2 + l^2 - L_{s,\theta=0}^2}{2rl} \right)
$$

This angle is then used to express \( \alpha(\theta) \) as:

$$
\alpha(\theta) = \alpha_0 - \theta
$$

Using the law of cosines again, the spring length as a function of \( \theta \) is:

$$
L_s(\theta) = \sqrt{r^2 + l^2 - 2rl \cos(\alpha(\theta))}
$$

Hooke’s Law gives the spring force:

$$
F_s(\theta) = -k\!\left(L_s(\theta) - L_0\right)
$$

The torque generated by this force is:

$$
\tau(\theta) = \lvert F_s(\theta) \rvert \cdot \lvert r \rvert \cdot \sin\!\big(\beta(\theta)\big)
$$

where

$$
\sin\!\big(\beta(\theta)\big) = \frac{l}{L_s(\theta)} \sin\!\big(\alpha(\theta)\big)
$$

For a multi-spring system (e.g., three springs), the total torque is the sum of individual contributions:

$$
\tau_{\text{tot}}(\theta) = \sum_{n=1}^{N} \tau_n(\theta) \cdot \Pi
$$

where:  
- \( N \) is the number of springs,  
- \( \Pi =
  \begin{cases}
    +1 & \text{if the spring is in front of the ankle} \\
    -1 & \text{if the spring is behind the ankle}
  \end{cases}
\)

Finite Element Analysis (FEA) was performed in **SolidWorks** to validate material choices. Manufacturing involved **CNC machining**, **waterjet cutting**, and manual methods such as lathes, mills, and bench drills.

### Functional Mechanism

The prosthetic foot uses a hinge joint allowing the top plate to rotate relative to the pylon during the gait cycle. During initial stance:
- The posterior and first anterior springs compress, providing baseline stability.
- The most anterior spring is **adjustable via a thumb screw**, enabling stiffness tuning based on the child’s weight.
- Pre-drilled holes (determined analytically) allow discrete adjustments.
- This front spring is mounted slightly lower than the others, engaging at a critical ankle angle to produce a nonlinear torque increase—mimicking natural human gait dynamics.

### Real-Time Gait Tracking

A computer vision pipeline was implemented using **ARUCO markers** and **OpenCV** to track ankle motion and gait patterns in real time. This system helps detect changes in gait due to growth, signaling when spring replacement or adjustment is needed.
