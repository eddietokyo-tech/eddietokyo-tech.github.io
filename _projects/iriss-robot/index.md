## Overview

As an undergraduate researcher in UCLA's Advanced Robotic Micro Surgery (ARMS) Lab, I worked on the Intraocular Robotic Interventional and Surgical System (IRISS) — a teleoperated platform for anterior and posterior ocular surgeries. My focus was developing a machine learning pipeline for real-time surgical assistance using OCT imaging.

## Key Contributions

- Designed key mechanical subsystems including a syringe end effector and a quick tool-change mechanism using SolidWorks.
- Built an image classification and regression pipeline in PyTorch using EfficientNet, ResNet, and U-Net architectures, achieving:
  - 98% classification accuracy of ocular structures.
  - 50μm prediction accuracy for depth estimation.
- Managed dataset collection, cleaning, preprocessing (MATLAB + Python), and model tuning from start to finish.
- Integrated ML inference with LabVIEW to enable live OCT-based decision support during surgical simulation.
- Collaborated closely with surgeons and engineers across disciplines.

## Outcome

- Achieved real-time classification performance suitable for surgical use.
- Pending co-authorship on a research publication.
- Contributed directly to advancing semi-automated cataract surgery in research settings.
