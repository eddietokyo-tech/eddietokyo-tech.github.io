## Overview

As a selected fellow for Stanford’s highly competitive undergraduate research program, I worked on designing and prototyping a pediatric medical device that mechanically stretches the heart to support growth in children with congenital defects. The goal was to develop a device safe for animal testing and future human trials. 

In addition to core research, while being a part of a leading robotics research lab I gained hands-on experience in embedded systems by designing PCBs using KiCad and prototyping high-performance tactile sensors for robotic applications."

## Key Contributions

- Designed and prototyped the heart stretching device using SolidWorks, 3D printing, and custom molding techniques.
- Conducted mechanical feasibility and FEA analysis to evaluate stretching performance and reliability.
- Worked alongside cardiovascular surgeons and biomedical researchers to align designs with clinical requirements.
- Followed FDA biocompatibility and testing guidelines for animal model preparation and verification.

## Outcome

- Delivered a functioning prototype ready for in vivo testing.
- Demonstrated mechanical viability and bio-safe design under supervised conditions.
- Strengthened interdisciplinary collaboration between engineering and surgical teams.
