## Overview

This project involved the design and development of a 6DOF robotic arm capable of executing controlled joint and task-space movements. The system was intended as a low-cost platform for exploring robotic kinematics, inverse dynamics, and physical interaction through external interfaces.

## Key Contributions

- Modeled the full robotic arm using SolidWorks, optimizing link lengths and joint spacing using MATLAB-based cost functions.
- Programmed inverse kinematics and Jacobian-based motion in Python and Arduino, including singularity detection and avoidance.
- Simulated robotic motion and torque requirements; tested joint responsiveness using servo motors.
- Integrated custom control inputs including gloves and button interfaces for user interaction.
- Rapid prototyped components using 3D printing for real-world testing and iteration.

## Outcome

- Demonstrated joint and Cartesian control across all 6 degrees of freedom.
- Built a simulation-to-physical testing pipeline using Python + Arduino + 3D-printed hardware.
- Applied theoretical robotics concepts to a hands-on design and control challenge.
