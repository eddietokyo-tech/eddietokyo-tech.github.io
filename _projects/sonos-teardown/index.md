# Overview

Designed and developed a smart RFID-enabled pet feeder that accurately scanned and identified pets via RFID tags. Enabling automated feeding by recognizing specific cats and opening the feeder bowl accordingly. Inspiration was the Surefeeder RFID feeder. System differentiated between my three cats and would open food door to the appropriate cat. Gained skills with SolidWorks, soldering, circuit design, oscilloscopes and multimeters.
