## Overview

As an engineering intern with General Atomics and UCLA’s Plasma Diagnostics Group, I supported the design and simulation of critical quasi-optical components used in nuclear fusion diagnostics. These components are essential for understanding and controlling plasma behavior in fusion reactors.

## Key Contributions

- Modeled millimeter-wave lenses, metal mirrors, and quasi-optical components using SolidWorks and COMSOL Multiphysics.
- Performed 3D full-wave simulations to analyze electromagnetic behavior and validate optical efficiency in fusion scenarios.
- Iteratively optimized component designs to enhance beam focusing and minimize losses — resulting in significant material cost reductions.

## Outcome

- Contributed directly to the diagnostic toolkit for next-gen fusion experiments.
- Delivered validated designs that enhanced system reliability and measurement precision.
- Presented findings to senior engineering staff and physicists at General Atomics.
